Run any program supporting XEMBED protocol in modal mode.

Usage:
    $ modal sh -c 'urxvt -embed $XEMBED'
or as I prefer:
    $ modal xembed -embed urxvt

"modal" runs what provided on a command line. Before the program is started,
"XEMBED" variable is set to window ID in which the program is supposed to embed
itself. "modal" grabs all keyboard events and forward them to the embedded
window. It also freezes pointer events. The effect is that you can not interact
with other windows until the process exits.

Install

     $ make && sudo make install
